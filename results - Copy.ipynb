    "We observed that time-dependent guidance modulates this trade-off curve. Decreasing schedules heavily anchor to the initial high guidance; if $w_{max}$ is pushed to extremes (e.g., 100), the model can occasionally force the correct object count, but the early structural distortions become baked in, and the subsequent lower guidance cannot recover the fidelity.\n",

    "Conversely, increasing schedules show that easing into higher guidance weights can bypass the severe color burn and structural collapse seen in constant high CFG, effectively mirroring lower CFG layouts (like CFG 12) even when reaching a $w_{max}$ of 50. However, this smoother convergence fails to enforce the strict numeric counts that the high CFG was intended to achieve. Ultimately, achieving absolute constraint alignment (e.g., exactly 3 apples) forces a total sacrifice of realism, suggesting that numeric counting remains a fundamental architectural limitation that time-dependent CFG alone cannot seamlessly fix.\n",
