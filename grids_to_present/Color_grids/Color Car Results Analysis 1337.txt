Prompt:
"A green sports car parked next to a red fire hydrant."

Schedules: baseline=7.5, average-constant, max-constant, exponentional, linear, triangular.
seed = 1337.
Results per column:
**Column 1:**
**baseline CFG = 7.5:** Nice result of Green sport Car next to fine looking red fire hydrant, The car not Sport but look fancy old-times car,

Column 2:
**Decreasing range(1.0,2.0) Schedules:** all the results are bit blurry but the objects look ok, the can just dont sport, and the hydrant very small.
**Increasing range(1.0,2.0) Schedules:** all the results very  blurry - in both exponent and linear we see artifacts of the shape of the car andwe cant see hydrant, and the triangular we see same hydarn as the decreasing(1.0,2.0).
**average-constant = 1.5**: very similar to the decreasing schedules.
**max-constant = 2.0** very similar to the decreasing schedules.


Column 2:
**Decreasing range(1.0,12.0) Schedules:** results nice - its like zoom in to the car so we can completley see it, but nice design and look sport, and also the hydrant no bad.
**Increasing range(1.0,12.0) Sachedules:**  Tactually look similar to the previous range(1.0,2.0) of the ** decreasing ** schedules.
**average-constant = 5.5**: very similar to the baseline CFG = 7.5,..
**max-constant = 12.0** similar to the decreasing range(1.0, 12.0).


Column 3:
**Decreasing range(7.0,50.0) Schedules:** All the results distorted, wired 2 unphotorealistic greenish cars, and very abstract small hydrant.background distorted to black in the middle and red in the sides..
**Increasing range(7.0,50.0) Schedules:**  Nice results, similar to the baseline but more sharp, and in the linear we got actualy "Fire" text on the hydarn.
**average-constant = 28.5**: wired results, of two cars above each other, greenish, and one is zoom in and cutted, the hydarn look red and good.
**max-constant = 50.0** similar to the Decreasing range(7.0,50.0).



Column 4:
**Decreasing range(7.0,100.0) Schedules:** Rvery wired result of silver small hydrant and two square greenish objects that we can see the start of the steering wheel  in the bottom wired greenish object.
**Increasing range(7.0,100.0) Schedules:**  Results similar to the previous increasing range(7.0, 50.0), But with drops of water on the image for all shecudles compare to the last range of each .
**average-constant = 53.5**: simialr to previous max-constant = 50.0, but the bottom car look more sport
**max-constant = 100.0** Very distorted result, we can see just abstract shapes of the car with wired red-light (as police) in the roof, and also the hydrant more look like beach-shower shape.
